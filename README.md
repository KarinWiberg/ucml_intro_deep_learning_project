# Project Description
The image classifier has been developed to classify different species of flowers.

## Data
The data contains labelled images of 102 spieces of flowers, see [link](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html).

## Objectives
The code contains multiple steps:
- Loading and preparing pre-labelled flower image data
- Training a new classifier for the pre-trained model 'vgg16'
- Saving the trained model to the local environment
- Using the saved, trained model to predict the flower of an image

# Environment
Python 3.8.5

## Jupyter Notebook/Ipython
The file _uc_intro_deep_learning_project_image_classifier_simple.ipynb_ is for Jupyter Notebook application and includes all code in one script

## Terminal/Python
The files _train.py_ and _predict.py_ are used to:
1) Train the classifier of a pre-built model and store the resulting model on the computer.
2) Predict the flower name of a new flower image.
